## Repository description
<p>This is the example Python project that illustrates how to use a REVIGO core library for your own projects.</p>

## How to compile and use this example
<p>To run this example you need the pythonnet package, a compiled RevigoCore library and a set of precompiled databases:
	<a href="http://revigo.irb.hr/Databases/GeneOntology.xml.gz" target="_blank">Gene Ontology</a> and 
	<a href="http://revigo.irb.hr/Databases/SpeciesAnnotations.xml.gz" target="_blank">Species annotations</a>, 
	or build your own databases with <a href="https://github.com/rajko-horvat/RevigoGenerateDatabases">RevigoGenerateDatabases</a> command line utility.</p>

## About REVIGO (REduce + VIsualize Gene Ontology) project
<p>Outcomes of high-throughput biological experiments are typically interpreted by statistical testing
for enriched gene functional categories defined by the Gene Ontology (GO). The resulting lists of GO terms 
may be large and highly redundant, and thus difficult to interpret.<p>
<p>REVIGO is a successful project to summarize long, unintelligible lists of Gene Ontology terms by finding a representative subset 
of the terms using a simple clustering algorithm that relies on semantic similarity measures.</p>
